Revision history for Perl module Math::Calculus::Differentiate
==============================================================

VERSION 0.2
* Released to CPAN on 1st September 2004.
* Completely re-written to use a tree structure internally.
* Precedence problems gone, and the / operator works.
* Interface changed from that of the 0.1 module.
* Documentation written. I didn't write any for 0.1, just in
  case somebody tried to use it.  ;-)

VERSION 0.1
* Released informally, badly written, never made it to CPAN,
  eventually scrapped completely.
